This example demonstrates a common TypeScript error where a type mismatch occurs during addition.  The function `add` is explicitly typed to accept two numbers and return a number. However, the code attempts to pass a string ('10') as the second argument. TypeScript correctly identifies this as an error, preventing potential runtime issues.  The solution focuses on input validation or type assertion to resolve the type mismatch.
